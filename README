FBB_base README


Project was built in Clion IDE.
Building and running instructions assume use of a bash shell. If you're using
Windows command line, use GCC 5 or later. No compiler flags should be required. 

--Building:-------------------------------------------------------------

Navigate to program directory and run commands:

$ cmake .

$ make

$ ./FBB_base

// Note: you make get a clock-skew warning on running make. This seems to be an issue
// with using an SSH session and does not affect the build process.


---Running:--------------------------------------------------------------

Navigate to program directory and run commands:

$./FBB_base

The FBB launcher will then request a filepath to the target file.
Note that the file read function is NOT ROBUST and will happily parse any file you give it
Giving a path to a non-.blif file will may cause a crash, so only feed it .blif files.

The launcher will request target solution ratio and solution ratio deviation

The launcher will give the option of running in verbose mode to show the progress of the
algorithm.

The launcher will request a number of runs of the algorithm to perform. This is useful in 
benchmarking when multiple runs must be performed. For any other purpose use a value of 1 

---filepaths-------------------------------------------------------------

For convenience a list of filepaths to the benchmark files is included:
benchmark_files/s9234.blif
benchmark_files/s13207.blif
benchmark_files/b17_opt.blif
benchmark_files/b20_opt.blif
benchmark_files/b22_opt.blif
benchmark_files/testModel.blif	// This file was generated from the example circuit
								// on page 50 of Practical Problems in VLSI Phyiscal
